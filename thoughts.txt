So I am working on getting the images to appear under each of the pokemon that get printed in the list
What I did right now is just set the limit to 2 pokemon in the api call setCurrentPageURL 
When we do useEffect we set the Pokemon variable to response.data.results which is just an array of however many pokemon you called 
So right now in Pokemon I have Bulba and Ivy 

But inside that array I only get an object with 2 things, name and url 
So I have to use that URL to access the rest of the information for that one specific pokemon
So I would need to use that URL to make another API call with that URL??????

Okay so now I have a variable to set the URL
But how do I actually get it from the data that we have? 
It must loop through each one when we get the name so look for when we set name... 
But that's like the final step because we map through each one.... 

Okay so I think what we have to do is think about react projects in parts, 
so what we can do is create a component called PokeImg where we can solely focus on the images of the pokemon
so if we can pass the URL of each pokemon to the PokeImg component then we can dig in each pokemon > sprites to find their individual image 

I think we have to go about this project completely different than what my mans was saying
We should not just be focused on printing a list if that makes sense
